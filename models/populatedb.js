//T.T. code review comments:

//Points to review:
//- include a header comment for a general description of each schema
//- include an event object that contains multiple articles (articles's ObjectId field references events instead of timelines), and events would then reference timelines. This way a user could choose among multiple news sources for an event
//- I think there's a way to automatically populate the paths of objects, check out http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html
//- don't forget to include a "list of keywords" as a member in the article and timline schemas (maybe under the "array" schemaType) because that's a significant part of the output of the classifier stage
//-(for later) it would be nice to visualize the timelines as a line with clickable events on it, not as a facebook-style newsfeed
//- think of a way to search for keywords within articles and timelines, we're probably going to need that

//Good points:
//- nice idea to use mongoose, it's very flexible and it's fit for our application

//A.M. code review comments:

//I agree with the above + can add the following:
//-Refactor the code by using functions rather than aa unique block
//-Can add comments that explain the procedure and why it was chosen
//-Rename some variables (indexOf... instead of just index for example)

//-Very good work and results (just need to make the code more structured)
